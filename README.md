UserDataBase
============

UserDataBase (udb) program, created for Code Fellows. Makes, stores, edits and deletes user profiles with HTML+Django.

This program was developed as an admissions test for Code Fellows'
    Python developer accelerator with no previous Django experience
    and the help of the official Django tutorial and StackOverflow, et al.
    Mostly StackOverflow.

The Heroku-enabled version of it might still be running at http://udb.herokuapp.com/
